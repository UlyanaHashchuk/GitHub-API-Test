2. Second page where is shown user `public_repos` is linked from the first page at different page route. On second page you can also:
   - Filter public repositories by the repository name with an input element and sort (highest first) by GitHub stars with checkbox element.
   - By clicking public repository name, you will be linked to that repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
