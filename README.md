## GitHub-API-Test :woman_scientist:

`GitHub-API-Test` is a React SPA by using Create React App and [GitHub API](https://github.com/) to do asynchronous calls. It includes two pages:

1. First page where GitHub user profile is fetched with input and button elements to show user profile details (`avatar`, `name`, `bio`, `public_repos`).
2. Second page where is shown user `public_repos`. Second page was linked from first page and is a different page route. On second page you can also filter public repositories by the **exact** repository name with an input element and sort (highest first) by GitHub stars with checkbox element. By clicking public repository name, you will be linked to that repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
